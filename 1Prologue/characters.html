                    <b>Ashley</b> is described in-game as academic, inquisitive, and forthright.
                    She seems to love books. She dislikes horror movies and dreams of being an author.
                    Ashley seems to be friendly, cheerful, and generally happy to be around her friends,
                    despite what happened a year ago. She seems to be more polite and serious than the
                    other protagonists, as she doesn't use profanity often like other group members.
                    Ashley is shown to be very observant, yet she is also easily scared due to her wild
                    imagination, which is shown in later chapters.

                    traits are charitable, funny and curious. He's very affable and has a witty sense of
                    humor which can be off-putting to his friends. He's analytical, not one to believe in
                    the occult, and isn't easily scared.
                    Chris is also a lover of gadgets, and can't go long without looking at his phone screen.
                    He dreams of being an app designer. He loves technology, and can't stand a place without
                    internet access.

                    She has a quick tongue and a sharp wit, and is known in the group for her
                    withering put-downs. Emily dreams of being a magazine style editor, has a
                    passion for fashion, and dislikes not getting her way in situations.
                    She is quick to temper, and very disagreeable when another's line of
                    thinking is not her own.

                    confident, trusting, and irreverent, Jessica is a typical provocative young woman,
                    who is quite brash in personality and dreams of being a model.
                    She is typically laid back, flirty and playful, constantly giving nicknames and acting
                    immature. However, once provoked, she can be quite defensive and fierce. She does seem
                    to care deeply for animals, being shocked and upset after killing a bird and seeing
                    the mauled deer.

                    other survivors tend to be humorous. He cares for his friends, acts as a brotherly
                    figure to Chris, and likes to make sure everyone is having a good time. He goes to
                    Sam for support after the loss of his sisters.
                    His dreams of following his father's footsteps in becoming a film producer make him very
                    knowledgeable about special effects and movie props and as such, he constantly uses
                    phrases and words from movies.

                    <b>Matthew Taylor</b>, referred to by his friends as <b>Matt</b>
                    is described in-game as motivated, ambitious and active,
                    which is mostly remarking on his visible passion for sports.
                    Matt is also described as having low bravery, which is mainly translated to mean
                    that he is a pushover, especially when it comes to his new girlfriend, Emily, to
                    whom he is fiercely loyal to. Their relationship can be clearly quite one-sided
                    at times, and Emily may take advantage of this trait.

                    the survivors for being promiscuous, and "loves women" despite his hatred of commitment.
                    Mike comes across as being self-absorbed, somewhat vain, immature and an all
                    round stereotypical 'jock'.

                    the most level-headed and friendly member of the group and is rarely the cause of drama,
                    even though she can be spunky and have somewhat of a strong personality.
                    Sam is a warm individual who cares deeply about her friends and their feelings.
                    She loves and genuinely cares about animals
                    and nature, and her dream job is to be a conservationist.
