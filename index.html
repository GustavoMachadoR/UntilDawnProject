            What you are about to experience is a almost full adaptation of the
            game Until Dawn™ Developed by Supermassive Games® and published by
            Sony Computer Entertainment to HTML/CSS.
            <br><br>
            Obviously this won't have any real gameplay, because the real focus is the story of the game.
            Until Dawn is a interactive drama adventure game. It was released for PlayStation 4 in August 2015.
            In the game, players assume control of eight young adults who have to survive in the Blackwood
            Mountain as their lives are threatened by an unknown threat. The game features a butterfly
            effect system, in which players have to make different choices which may lead to unforeseen
            consequences and influence the game's narrative. All the playable characters can survive or die
            in the game depending on players' choices. Players can also explore the environment from a
            third-person perspective and pick up different clues that may help solve the mystery.
